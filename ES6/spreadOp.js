// But now i want some more elements in new array including previouce ones

As We know array is a refrence type and when we assign an refrence type to new variable it assign 
its refrence to variable not the values of the array becaouse of this when we change something in 
a variable it will effect the original one. Spread Operater resolves this issue now
